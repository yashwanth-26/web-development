			<h1>STORY</h1>
			<br>
			<p class="b">
				&emsp;A man found a cocoon of a butterfly.<br> &emsp;One day a
				small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly for several
				hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole.<br>

				&emsp;Until it suddenly stopped making any progress and looked like
				it was stuck.<br> &emsp;So the man decided to help the
				butterfly. He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining
				bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily, although it
				had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.<br> &emsp;The
				man didn’t think anything of it and sat there waiting for the wings
				to enlarge to support the butterfly. But that didn’t happen. The
				butterfly spent the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around
				with tiny wings and a swollen body.<br> &emsp;Despite the kind
				heart of the man, he didn’t understand that the restricting cocoon
				and the struggle needed by the butterfly to get itself through the
				small opening; were God’s way of forcing fluid from the body of the
				butterfly into its wings. To prepare itself for flying once it was
				out of the cocoon.
			</p>

			<h1>Moral of the story:</h1>
			<p class="b">&emsp;Our struggles in life develop our strengths.
				Without struggles, we never grow and never get stronger, so it’s
				important for us to tackle challenges on our own, and not be relying
				on help from others.</p>
